Authentication - It means to identify yourself and provide an identity such as username and password which justifies you are you not someone else.Its simply conforming your identity.
Always first test for success.It means making sure you are you.

Authorization - Authorization always comes after authentocation success . Authorization means Ok you have authenticated yourself but do you have access to service ?
its where we can granular control . It means for a service if you are authorized aceess what kind of access ( read, write, both or  no access at all ).


Azure Active Directory (AAD) : Its the main tool to manager users and permissions in Azure . Azure directory is there in industry since earlty age of 2000 but at that time 
it was only in premise and initally designed to manage permissions on fax machine, printers and users as well.
At that time nobody thought this on premise infra will move to cloud based infra and we would need Web based products .

Hence Azure Active Directory is web based tool to manager users and permssions in Azure ecosystem. Please consider them two differnet products.

- You cant have an Azure account without an AAD service. When we sign up for account for this first time thats when AAD creates account .
- AAD can manage users and permissions on both on premise and cloud resources when we are talking about Hybrid cloud.
- tenant - Its nothing but organization ( chekcout AAD in web console).
