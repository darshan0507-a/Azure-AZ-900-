Storage : Its something in which we can store data.
Types of storage.
- Blob - Very verstaile storage type.
- Disk - Store the data on disk.
- File - Fully managed file storage to expand storage in on-premise data.
- Archive - To store and cheaper way to store massive amounts of data.

In Azure , storage account is unique namespace which means a link will be created which is unique. Its similar to Gcloud (gs://<name of storage bucket).
Every object in Azure has its own web address.

For example - my account name is acloudguru
then my storage name would be - acloudguru.<storage type>.core.windows.net

================================

Blob Storage-  Blob stands for Binary large object. SO blob is any data (bits and bytes ). In Blob storage , all these items are stored which are blobs stored in 
large containers and each blob will have a unqiue address thus it becomes easy to search the blob in Storage account.
It can store everything - images, audio, videos, log files , big backup data.
3 Types of blob storage : 
Block Blob - Store text and binary data upto 4.7TB. made up of individually managed block of data.
==========
Append BLob- Its used for append data . Mostly used for virtual machine log files.
==========
Page - store files upto 8 TB.Any part of the file could be accessed anytime.Virtual hard disk.

=============================================================================

Pricing Tiers for Blob - Hot ,Cool and Archive.
Hot- Frquenclty accessed files and high access cost.
Cool - Lower storage cost and high access time. Data remians here for atleast 30 days.
Archive - Lowest cost and high access time.

============================================================================
Disk STorage - Directly attached to VM and azure manages the uptime and backup  of disk . We dont have to look after the disk.Azure guaranttee the performance.
Type of disks : 
a) HDD - Spinning hard drive ,low cost and suitable for backups and test enviornment.
b) Standard SSD - Good to use for production scenarios.High reliablity and scalability and low latency.
c) Premium SSD - SUper fast , high performance and used for critical workloads. Low latency - fast data retrival.
d) Ultra disk - For the most demanding data , data drievn workloads, Disks upto 64 TB. lOwest millisecond latency rate - SUper fast retreval.
