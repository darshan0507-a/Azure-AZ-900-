a) Azure CLI is text only way to manage resources through which we can pass structured commands.
b) Powershell is fully supported by Azure on all platforms (linux, windows, MacOS) . It manages cmdlets and modules.
c) What is scalability - Scale out , scale up - scale down . Use auto scaling for critical scenarios.
As resource demand increases, Azure can split the demand over more resources and scale the application
d) What is Elasticity - Abiltiy to quickly expand and decrease computing resources not just VM's.Elasticity enables scaling.
e)Agility - Fast development , Test and launch softwares.
f)fault Tolerant - It means zero down time to services provided by Azure or Ensure services and applications remain available in the event of a failure.
g) Disaster recovery - Plan to recover incase of failure and get back the data from the point of failure.

Cloud Services Models
=====================
IaaS - virtaul servers, storage and networking services.
PaaS - Middleware Tools - Database mgmt tools.
SaaS - IaaS+PaaS and different types of apps.(like Office 365,SQL ,.. more)

difference between OPEX and CAPEX - Perational expense and Capital expense
================================
OPEX is an ongoing cost for running a business. CAPEX is the cost of acquiring assets.


Region and Availability zones
============================
a) Region is big geographical area and AZ are actual data centeres. In a region , there can be multiple AZ's.
To choose a region keep 3 points in mind
- Location : Choose a region closest to users to reduce latency.
- Features - all services are not availble in all regions
- Cost - price of services vary from region to region

Resource Group and Azure Resource Manager
=========================================
Resource group - Everything inside Azure is actually inside Azure Resource group.While all the resources must be in a resource group but resource group is actually not a resource.
It holds related resources that you need to manage for an application .
Consider Resource group as Docker container. (Analogy).

Facts on Resouce group
======================
- Each resource can only exist in single resource group.
- You can add or remove any resouce to resource group at any time.
- You can move resource from one resource group to another group.
- Resources from multiple region can be in one group.
- You can give user access to resource group and eveything in it.
- Resources can interact with each other even if they are in different resource groups.
- A resourec group has a location or region as it sstores the metadata about the resources in it. 

Azure Resource Manager : Its deployment and management service for Azure.All the resource goes through ARM .
======================
If you want to use SQL go through ARM, If you want to use azure cloudshell go to ARM , or any other service.
ARM API handles all these requests.

facta are in video - DO learn.
=============================================

Virtual machine : VM are the core of Azure compute and widely used.
================
- A VM is your machine exclusively.
- No need to buy , control hardware , Azure does it all.
- Pricing go as per resources additon but model is same pay as you goor pay by hour.


Scale sets: Create a VM from an exisiting VM .Its similar to Instance groups concept.This provides high availabilty to the applications.
===========

Hence VM and scale sets are part of IaaS services
====================================================


App Service- Its fully managed app service.Servers network , storage all handled by App service . You just need to worry about code and business logic.its simiar to App engine in GCP.
=========
App service is PaaS.
So App service comes in two flavours - Web App and COntainer App service.
Webapp - runs of linux and windows, supports all sorts of languages, easy to integrate with Azure services and supports auto scaling and load balancing.
Container - We know that already . Runs container.


Azure container Instances
========================
Its primary Azure service to run container workloads.Workload is process or application.Its ondemand service and follow pay as you go model.

Azure Kubernetes service
========================
Its used for management for so many containers.Open source container orchestration, managment ,application deployment and scaling service.

Azure container registery
=========================
Its similar to Docker service but ACR is Microsoft managed service.
It keeps track of current valid container images.It manages it files and artificats. Use of Azure identity and security to allowed to authenticate container images authenticity.

Pod is the smallest unit in Kubernetes . A pod can have multiple containers with same specification and features , dependencies and libraries.

Azure Functions : Its similar to lambda function. You will be charged only when function executes on request .
