a) Azure CLI is text only way to manage resources through which we can pass structured commands.
b) Powershell is fully supported by Azure on all platforms (linux, windows, MacOS) . It manages cmdlets and modules.
c) What is scalability - Scale out , scale up - scale down . Use auto scaling for critical scenarios.
As resource demand increases, Azure can split the demand over more resources and scale the application
d) What is Elasticity - Abiltiy to quickly expand and decrease computing resources not just VM's.Elasticity enables scaling.
e)Agility - Fast development , Test and launch softwares.
f)fault Tolerant - It means zero down time to services provided by Azure or Ensure services and applications remain available in the event of a failure.
g) Disaster recovery - Plan to recover incase of failure and get back the data from the point of failure.

Cloud Services Models
=====================
IaaS - virtaul servers, storage and networking services.
PaaS - Middleware Tools - Database mgmt tools.
SaaS - IaaS+PaaS and different types of apps.(like Office 365,SQL ,.. more)

difference between OPEX and CAPEX - Perational expense and Capital expense
================================
OPEX is an ongoing cost for running a business. CAPEX is the cost of acquiring assets.


Region and Availability zones
============================
a) Region is big geographical area and AZ are actual data centeres. In a region , there can be multiple AZ's.
To choose a region keep 3 points in mind
- Location : Choose a region closest to users to reduce latency.
- Features - all services are not availble in all regions
- Cost - price of services vary from region to region

Resource Group and Azure Resource Manager
=========================================
Resource group - Everything inside Azure is actually inside Azure Resource group.While all the resources must be in a resource group but resource group is actually not a resource.
It holds related resources that you need to manage for an application .
Consider Resource group as Docker container. (Analogy).

Facts on Resouce group
======================
- Each resource can only exist in single resource group.
- You can add or remove any resouce to resource group at any time.
- You can move resource from one resource group to another group.
- Resources from multiple region can be in one group.
- You can give user access to resource group and eveything in it.
- Resources can interact with each other even if they are in different resource groups.
- A resourec group has a location or region as it sstores the metadata about the resources in it. 

Azure Resource Manager : Its deployment and management service for Azure.All the resource goes through ARM .
======================
If you want to use SQL go through ARM, If you want to use azure cloudshell go to ARM , or any other service.
ARM API handles all these requests.

facta are in video - DO learn.
=============================================

Virtual machine : VM are the core of Azure compute and widely used.
================
- A VM is your machine exclusively.
- No need to buy , control hardware , Azure does it all.
- Pricing go as per resources additon but model is same pay as you goor pay by hour.


Scale sets: Create a VM from an exisiting VM .Its similar to Instance groups concept.This provides high availabilty to the applications.
===========

Hence VM and scale sets are part of IaaS services
====================================================


App Service- Its fully managed app service.Servers network , storage all handled by App service . You just need to worry about code and business logic.
