a)Virtual Network or VNet which is similar to VPC in AWS . It defines a private network for comanies which allows their resources to communicate securely with in the network and outside
the network .
As the name suggestes , virtual network is virtual , its there for you but you cannot touch it , feel it as you dont have hardware access.Its abstracted.
A Vnet belongs to single region and all the resources should also be in the same region.Howerver , cross region Vnet communication is possible.


b) Address Space or IP address range - Each Vnet will have a address range from whihc it can assign IP address to its resources .
c)Subnet - Subnet means segmentation of big network into smaller network . We do this because in this way it becomes easy to manage resources in the small networks.
Securing a subnet is easy in comparison to securing a whole network.

c) Load Balancer : Load balancer is used to manage the incoming traffic to other virtual machines so not just one VM will need to handle everything.
We can put and design rules in load balancer to let it understand how does load balaner will balace the load , how will it handle user requests and so on....
Scenarios where Load balacer can be used.
- Internet traffic - explained above.
- Internet networks - It can also be managed for internal applications.
- Port Forwarding - Traffic can be forwarded to specific port to handle the traffic.
- Outbound traffic.

d) VPN Gateway - VPN Gateway is a specoic type of virtaul network gateway that is used to send encrypted traffic between Azure resources with in VNet and pulic internet.
e) Application Gateway : Its a high level kind of Load balancer. Load balancer can take inbound internet traffic and distribute it on the VM's which are in backend pool . It recognizes the 
traffic on the basis of IP address or send the request to specific port (port forwarding) .
However, Application gateway makes use of applications like HTTP request, URI header . So by updating these values in application load balancer configuration we can handle traffic by using some
different parameteres.
- Easy scalebale.
- E2E encryption
- Multi AZ service.
- Multi site hosting.

f) CDN - COntent delivery network - Used for content caching , 
Cache the data at nearest location where usesr are so application wont have to fetch the data from the original machine.It keeps the copy of data at edge nodes.
